## About Me

I just begin studying to build a website in mid 2016. I got interested with **web design & development**
because i see that the growth demand of technology is getting bigger. Lots of new technology is being updated
each day! and I just wanna a be a part of it. Nowadays we all must have a gadget that we bring at work or when we have
a vacation because we desperately need it! it's like our magic pocket in Doraemon :joy:

Beside the growth of technology that got me interested it's also because of my father that have a project that
needs web development technology for people prosperity.
